Interitus
***************

Welcome to the office documentation of Interitus, an open-source graphical drag'n'drop programming interface.
It supports Ev3, Arduino and Raspberry Pi (or other platforms via plugin).
Our opinion is a simplification for developers should never limit them.

This guide will tell you how Interitus is made and how to contribute.
You will also get how to write a Plugin.
